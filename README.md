Code samples from past and present projects I have worked / am working on.

Fling to the Finish: The game I'm currently working on.

A True Ace in Space: Unreal Engine 4 Group Project
I worked on the player spaceship movement, as well as enemy spaceship AI states.
                     
Aftermath: Unity 3D Group Project
I worked on all of the programming aspects of the game.

Utility Theory: Unity Solo AI R&D Project
I worked on a way of handling AI that I believe could be more realistic than state machines or behaviour states.

Game Design Workshop: Unity 3D Group Project
I programmed major aspects of the game.
