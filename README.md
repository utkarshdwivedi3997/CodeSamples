Code samples from past and present projects I have worked / am working on.

- [Fling to the Finish](Fling%20to%20the%20Finish%20(Current%20Project)): The game I'm currently working on.

- [A True Ace in Space](_%20A%20True%20Ace%20in%20Space): Unreal Engine 4 Group Project
I worked on the player spaceship movement, as well as enemy spaceship AI states.

- [Utility Theory](_%20Utility%20Theory): Unity Solo AI R&D Project
I worked on a way of handling AI that I believe could be more realistic than state machines or behaviour states.

- [Game Design Workshop](_%20Game%20Design%20Workshop%20Project): Unity 3D Group Project
I programmed major aspects of the game.
